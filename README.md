This work contains:
1. 🔐 Define Access Key and Secret Variables
2. 📋 Check All Existing Buckets
3. 🛠️ Create AWS Bucket: Customize Your Bucket Name
4. 📁 Store CSV Files from Local Laptop Disk to AWS Bucket and Custom Folders
5. 📂 Read CSV File from Bucket using Local Python 🐍: Print the DataFrame

**Conclusion:**
The purpose of the process was to verify the connection status of our credential files, namely the access key and secret key, between the local Python environment and our AWS account. The successful execution of actions, such as creating a bucket, deleting a bucket, uploading a CSV file, or the ETL process, aims to ensure the successful connection status of credential files, specifically the access key and secret key, between the local Python environment and the AWS account. This confirmation indicates that the access key and secret key are correctly configured, facilitating a seamless interaction between Python and our AWS resources.
